about the AI final project / presentation:

- you will have one week after the final lecture to make an AI of your own using what you learned so far

- during that one week , you will have to find a dataset, clean it, train an AI based on that dataset and make it as accurate as possible

- after that is done you will make a presentation explaining details about the AI you made (what can it do, the dataset you chose, and how would you see it being used in the real world, the challanges you came across when making it, etc.)

- you will need to get the approval of at least half the people present during the presentation to pass the course

you can go beyond the scope of this course when creating your project , it is encoureged!
